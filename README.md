# IntegritiREST
Basic user interface for Integriti REST/XML API. 
There isn't technically an easy interface to use for sending REST commands to Integriti. There is the samples section of the API docs, but that is buggy and hard to use, so I wrote my own GUI that I frequently use. 

## Installation
This requires the relevant licenses and comms handlers to be setup on Integriti.
This code is just standard C# using Winforms (.NET Framework 4.7.2).
You should be able to just build the solution and run.
